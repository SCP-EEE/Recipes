[Name] Po4a
[Summary] Update both the PO files and translated documents in one shot
[Description]
The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

po4a extracts the translatable material from the original document, and places it into a PO file that is well adapted to the translation work.

Once the translation is completed in the PO file, po4a re-injects the translation into the structure of the document to generate a translated document.

If the translation is only partially completed, the original (English) text is used instead. This ensures that your translated documentation is always both up to date with regard to the original one, and as translated as possible.

# Note: at least on kernel 5.6.10, overlayfs fails to merge the
# XFConf and LibXFCE4Util directories correctly when the lower
# directories list includes LibXFCE4Util before XFConf. Here we
# workaround that problem by including XFConf first. Another
# workaround is to instruct Scripts to use the unionfs-fuse backend,
# by modifying /System/Settings/Scripts/Directories.conf. It is
# expected that this problem does not occur on more recent versions
# of overlayfs.

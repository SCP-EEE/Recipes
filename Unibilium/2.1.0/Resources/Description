[Name] Unibilium
[Summary] A terminfo parsing library
[Description] Unibilium is a very basic terminfo library. It can read and write ncurses-style terminfo files, and it can interpret terminfo format strings. It doesn't depend on curses or any other library. It also doesn't use global variables, so it should be thread-safe.

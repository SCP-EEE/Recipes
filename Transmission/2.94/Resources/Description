[Description] Transmission has been built from the ground up to be a lightweight, yet powerful 
BitTorrent client. Its simple, intuitive interface is designed to integrate 
tightly with whatever computing environment you choose to use. Transmission 
strikes a balance between providing useful functionality without feature bloat. 
Furthermore, it is free for anyone to use or modify.

Transmission runs natively on over five operating systems. Seamless configura-
tion of your network, intelligent banning of peers who send corrupted data, and
built in Peer Exchange are some of the features which enable Transmission to 
download your files as quickly as possible. All this is done in the background, 
without the user having to worry about complicated settings.

[Name] UTF8Proc
[Summary] A clean C library for processing UTF-8 Unicode data
[Description] utf8proc is a small, clean C library that provides Unicode normalization, case-folding, and other operations for data in the UTF-8 encoding. It was initially developed by Jan Behrens and the rest of the Public Software Group, who deserve nearly all of the credit for this package. With the blessing of the Public Software Group, the Julia developers have taken over development of utf8proc, since the original developers have moved to other projects.

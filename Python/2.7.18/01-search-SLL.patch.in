Python searches each element of PREFIXES + 'lib/pythonx.y/site-packages'
for modules, and also for .pth files. This patch ensures that the
$goboSystem/Aliens/PIP tree is included in that, allowing other packages
to provide their own .pth files when necessary. It relies on the legacy tree in
order to keep the patch simple - the 'lib/pythonx.y/site-packages'
suffix is hard-coded later on.

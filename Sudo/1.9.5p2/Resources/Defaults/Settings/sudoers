# Cmnd alias specification

# Defaults specification

#If you want to have sudo send mail to someone in the cases that sudo
#would like to send mail (see the mail_* options - defaults are normal),
#uncomment this line and fill in an appropriate address for mailto:
#Default mailto="", mailerpath=/bin/sendmail

Defaults !env_reset, setenv

# User privilege specification

# user #0 is normally in group sys, allowed later anyway.
# (user id's can't syntactically be allowed to
#  do things, in this file -- this was here:
#  gobo	ALL=(ALL) ALL
# )

# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

# Same thing without a password
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
%sys           ALL=(ALL)       ALL

# Samples
#%users  ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

[Name] GPGME
[Summary] C library to add cryptographic support to programs.
[Description] GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a C language library that
allows to add support for cryptography to a program.  It is designed
to make access to public key crypto engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier
for applications.  GPGME provides a high-level crypto API for
encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management. GPGME uses GnuPG and GpgSM as its backends to support
OpenPGP and the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

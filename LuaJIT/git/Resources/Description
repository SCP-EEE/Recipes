[Description] LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time Compiler for the Lua programming
language. Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose,
stand-alone language. LuaJIT is based on the Lua 5.1.x virtual machine and
bytecode interpreter from lua.org. It compiles bytecode to native x86
(i386+) machine code to speed up the execution of Lua programs.
